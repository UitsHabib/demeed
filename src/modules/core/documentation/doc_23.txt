    * the work of this function is to match the patterns and get all the .routes files inside an array and return the array.

    3. the getGlobbedPaths makes the routes included dynamically.

    'src/modules/**/*.routes.js' : ** makes sense folder. * make sense a file. .routes.js makes sense the file's ending.
